A fork of [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/), "doctored" to use [Redgate's](https://www.red-gate.com/) [fork of highlight.js](https://github.com/red-gate/highlight.js).

There are a couple of additional styles (vs.css and vs2015.css) included in addition to reveal's default zenburn.css. More are available from the [highlight.js source repo](https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js/tree/master/src/styles)
